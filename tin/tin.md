### Tin is a simple web browser, aiming for minimalism and powerful features. It is designed to work well in small spaces.


## ⚠️ Codelink is not being worked on!
Developing for any of the Codelink projects has been paused except for Zentrox, which has been moved to a [seperate repository](https://github.com/wervice/zentrox).
Currently, I do not plan on working on Codelink again. I did not archive this repository, as I may come back to it.
The current state of the projects may contain bugs and does not use the latest versions of NW.js and Chromium. Thus I do not recommend using any of the applications.
Thank you for showing interest in Codelink 🙂
