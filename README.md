## Installation
> Codelink is designed for developers

To run Codelink on your computer, you can go to the release page and download the Windows zip.    
There, you can find an exe file. All you need to do now, is doubble click it and it launches.   
If would recommend to store it in your home folder and add a desktop shortcut. Please don't try to take
the exe and run it standalone. You may almost certainly breake your download.    

If you want to try Codelink on Linux or the above method failed, please try the following or open an issue

1. Download code as zip & unpack
