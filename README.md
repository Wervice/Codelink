<div align=center>Codelink is an open source family of applications, specialized for programming. Codelink supports Windows and Linux.</div>

## Which apps does Codelink feature?
- Manuscript: A advanced note taking app using Markdown

- Tin: A small browser built with Chrome

## What is up next?

## Installation 
Codelink apps are portable, so you don't need to install them.   
You can download the latest builds for Linux and Windows here: [Releases](https://github.com/Wervice/Codelink/releases/)   
The current release version is 1.9.

Linux now also gets an installer script called `install.sh`. Please run this script using `sudo`.
For Windows, please run `{appname}.exe`. I will create an installer for Windows soon.

## Which technologies does Codelink use?
Codelink uses NW.js for apps that run localy on your computer. NW.js is simmilar to Electron, but a whole lot faster and easier.   
For Zentrox, I use ExpressJS and no front end libraries.

## Bugs...
When you find a bug, I would appreciate, if you'd open an issue on GitHub, or contact me at wervice@proton.me .    
It may take a whole to fix a bug, but I'm happy about every report.
