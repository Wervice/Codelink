Codelink is a simple tool, that helps you coding. It lets you launch your most important applications from once place, search for bugfixes faster and more. It uses NW.js to create a fast and stable interface.

It features an own browser for quick searches and bug fixes. It was tested under Windows 10. It only needs NW from NPM to run. You can install it as [follows](#installation).

It comes with no AI features by default.

## Installation
> Codelink is devloped for programmers

For the instllation, you need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your computer.   
You can get Node.JS from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

Download this code and open your terminal in the folder.   
Install NW.js in this folder:   
``npm install nw``   
Run Codelink:   
``npm run dev``

If this method doesn't work, you can also download the NW.js binaries from [nwjs.io](https://nwjs.io/) and run  
``
nw {Full path to codelink code}
``

I will soon update this to a better solution using a package manager.   

## Usage
You can now click a link on the left side to setup a launcher.   
Please enter a correct command (Example: ``code`` or ``subl``)   
The search icon will open a small browser window, that is optimized for
quick searches and bug fixes.   
It lets you set bookmarks, navigate and more.

## Early stage
Codelink is still in a very early stage.   
There will soon be a browser update, an improved design and more functions.   
So, please give me feedback and stick around, so you want miss the update.
