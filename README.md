Codelink is a simple tool, that helps you coding. It lets you launch your most important applications from once place, search for bugfixes faster and more. It uses NW.js to create a fast and stable interface.

It features an own browser for quick searches and bug fixes. It was tested under Windows 10. It only needs NW from NPM to run. You can install it as [follows](#installation).

It comes with no AI features by default.

## Installation
> Codelink is devloped for programmers

To run Codelink on your computer, you can go to the release page and download the Windows zip.    
There, you can find an exe file. All you need to do now, is doubble click it and it launches.

If this doesn't work, you can try the next method:

For this instllation, you need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your computer.   
You can get Node.JS from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

Download this code and open your terminal in the folder.   
Install NW.js in this folder:   
``npm install nw``   
Run Codelink:   
``npm run dev``

If this method doesn't work, you can also download the NW.js binaries from [nwjs.io](https://nwjs.io/) and run  
``
nw {Full path to codelink code}
``

I will soon update this to a better solution using a package manager.
