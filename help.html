    <h2>Codelink Manual</h2>
    Codelink features multiple tools, you can use and play with.<br>
    <h3>Links</h3>
    The first one is the ability to link your programs with Codelink.<br>
    You can simply click one of the 3 first icons on the main windows.<br>
    There you can setup a command to run the app and it will start.<br>
    This then is stored for the next time you click it. If you want to reset it, right click it.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>FileTree</h3>
    FileTree is a full file manager for developers. It allows you to easily navigate
    with your keyboard, run special commands very quick and more.<br>
    You can run it by clicking the 4th icon on the main screen.<br>
    <h3>Browser</h3>
    Codelink's browser is a Chromium based browser with a bug fixing assistant and more
    features. It has no history.<br>
    You can run it, by clicking the mug icon on the main screen.



    <h2>Legal disclaimer</h2>
    Most of the icons used in Codelink, FileTree and the Browser are designed by <a href="https://icons8.com">Icons8</a>.

    To inprove the look of Codelink, some links & dropdowns get an custom icon. They all are from Icons8.com.<br>
    The logos still belong to the teams and companies that originally created the application, I recreated the logo of.
